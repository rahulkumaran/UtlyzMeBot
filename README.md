A telegram bot which helps you do loads of things from the telegram app itself without you having to migrate from one app to another.<br>
It allows you to do the following things:<br>

(1) Ask for news updates<br>
(2) Ask for lyrics of songs<br>
(3) Ask for the wikipedia summary of a particular topic<br>
(4) Ask for certain Facebook updates like number of friend requests, unread messages and unseen notifications.<br>

## How To Use This
One can simply download the Telegram app and type `UtlyzMeBot` in the search coloumn.<br>
After you find the bot, click on it and then click on the `Start` button to start using the bot!<br>


## Learning By Example

### (1) To start and ask the bot for help to find out what the bot does, you can type the following:<br>
    /start
    /help
### (2) To get Facebook updates, you can execute the following command:<br>
    Example : /fb abcde@xyz.com 1234567
    NOTE : The first time you use this feature, you might not get the valid results as Facebook blocks this request to log in to   
    your ID. In such a case, you'll get a notification on Facebook saying "We've noticed an unusual login from a device or
    location you don't usually use. Please review." . Click on the notification and then click on "This was me." and try running
    the command again from the bot. This time it will work.
